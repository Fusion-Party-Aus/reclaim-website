We're socialists who think freedom matters more than state control.</p>

        <p class="text-3xl font-bold text-center">We won't form government in 2026. We know that.</p>
        
        <p>But every vote we win sends a message that Victorians are done with corporate-funded major parties. Every seat we contest forces them to explain why they won't adopt our policies. Every question we ask in Parliament exposes waste they'd rather hide.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The Greens started with one seat in 1996. Now they're kingmakers.</strong> Every movement starts somewhere.</p>
        
        <p>But we're also impatient. People are hurting now. So we'll fight like we can win. We'll use every tool Parliament gives us. We'll drag the major parties toward policies that actually help working people.</p>

      <div class="bg-grey-dark text-white p-10 rounded-lg">
        <p class="text-2xl font-bold text-mint mb-4">And here's the part that might surprise you:</p>
        <p class="mb-4">We don't care who implements these policies. If Labor reads this manifesto and decides to build 50,000 public homes, criminalise wage theft, and give Infrastructure Victoria binding authority - <strong>that's a win.</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-4">If the Liberals suddenly discover fiscal responsibility by cutting infrastructure waste and investing in revenue-generating assets - <strong>that's a win.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">We're not here to protect intellectual property. We're here to fix Victoria.</p>
