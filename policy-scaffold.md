## STYLE GUIDE REMINDERS

✅ **DO:**

- Provide specific numbers and timelines
- Show who profits from the current system
- Give concrete examples (suburbs, people, amounts)
- Explain HOW we'll pay for it
- Include evidence from other cities/countries
- Be punchy and direct
- Make it personal ("what this costs YOU")

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use jargon or technical language
- Make vague promises without timelines
- Ignore the costs
- Claim something is "free" when it's tax-funded
- Attack people (attack systems and corruption)
- Use academic/bureaucratic tone
- Say "we'll consider" or "we'll explore" (say what you WILL do)

## EXAMPLE: Good vs Bad Policy Writing

### ❌ BAD (Vague, No Numbers, No Timeline)
"We support affordable housing and will work with stakeholders to explore options for increasing supply through a range of mechanisms."

### ✅ GOOD (Specific, Costed, Timeline)
"We'll build 50,000 public homes over 4 years at a cost of $25 billion, funded by a $25 billion bond issue. This will house 125,000 people currently in housing stress and reduce rents by 15% across Melbourne."
