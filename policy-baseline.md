# Fix Our Systems, Fix Our Country

*Our country became prosperous because we developed systems that incentivised <u>long-term</u> economic growth.*
*Over the past 50 years, those systems have been steadily dismantled dismantled and replaced with ones that incentivise <u>short-term</u> gains instead.*
*Growth continued for a while - not because the systems were good, but because of the cultural legacy which shaped our expectations and decisions.*

*But cultural legacy is temporary.*
*It evolves from generation to generation, and changes as we adapt to the world around us.*
*Now that legacy has been diluted to the point that long-term growth is no longer an outcome of our systems.*

*This is not the fault of the youth, nor the immigrant, nor the retiree.*

*It is the fault of an ultra-wealthy minority who used their influence over government to bend our systems to their own advantage.*

*And we cannot just go backwards. The systems of the past will not work again in the present, the world has changed too much.*

*We must Rebuild systems that generate long-term growth from first principles.*
*We must Reclaim our economy for the benefit of our future generations.*

*Fix our systems, fix our country.*
*It is the only way.*

**Australia will not secure its future until we fix the systems that reward short-term gain at the expense of long-term prosperity.**

# RECLAIM OUR ECONOMY

## Restore the Fair Go

### **Deliver UBI / Citizen’s Dividend for All Australians**

1. Every Australian will receive a Citizens Dividend set at the Henderson Poverty Line, paid automatically and unconditionally, replacing existing baseline welfare payments.
    1. A reliable income foundation will support stability through job changes, illness, and economic transition.
    2. Personal autonomy and dignity will be restored by providing income support without surveillance, compliance, or conditionality.
    3. Administrative simplicity and clarity will be achieved by consolidating fragmented welfare programs into a single universal payment.
    4. Broader participation in Australia’s economic prosperity will result from universal access to a baseline level of support.
    5. Adaptation to AI-driven labour change will be strengthened by separating basic economic security from full-time employment.

**Design rationale**  
A Universal Basic Income was selected over expanded conditional welfare and negative income tax models because it establishes a clear, permanent income floor without eligibility churn, behavioural conditions, or ongoing recalibration. Conditional and targeted systems were assessed as structurally complex, exclusion-prone, and poorly suited to labour-market volatility. The design intent is to provide a stable baseline that does not require frequent policy intervention as economic conditions change.

**System interaction**  
The Citizens Dividend replaces baseline income-support payments that provide subsistence-level income, while leaving supplementary and needs-based supports intact. Payments related to disability, caring responsibilities, housing assistance, or additional costs remain layered above the baseline. Interaction with the tax system occurs through ordinary income taxation rather than withdrawal rules, avoiding sharp cliffs and preserving universality.

**Economic and institutional logic**  
The policy alters incentive structures by separating basic income security from continuous employment. This reduces effective marginal tax rates created by benefit withdrawal, increases flexibility around part-time work, retraining, caregiving, and entrepreneurship, and improves worker bargaining position without relying on compliance enforcement. The design assumes that labour participation is primarily driven by income above subsistence levels, job quality, and social participation rather than coercive welfare conditionality.

**Risk and failure modes**  
Key risks include fiscal miscalibration if the baseline level is poorly set, political pressure to reintroduce conditionality that erodes universality, inflationary pressure if introduced without complementary supply-side reforms, and partial implementation that preserves complexity while losing coherence. Indicators of underperformance would include persistent poverty despite rollout, re-emergence of multiple overlapping income tests, or labour-market responses that significantly deviate from modelling assumptions.

**Evidence and precedent**  
Relevant evidence includes international income-floor pilots, negative income tax experiments, Australian basic-income modelling, and long-standing universal payment frameworks such as pensions and family benefits. Results consistently show strong poverty-reduction effects and administrative simplification, with labour-market impacts varying by design scale, interaction with taxation, and surrounding economic conditions. No single trial is treated as decisive; the policy draws on converging findings across multiple approaches.

**Implementation outline**  
Implementation is sequenced around legislative consolidation of baseline payments, integration with existing tax and reporting systems, and a managed transition period to prevent duplication or income gaps. Dependencies include accurate income data flows, agency coordination, and clear separation between baseline and supplementary supports. Detailed operational delivery is handled through a separate Delivery Plan document.

### **Guarantee Fair Wages for All Workers**

Reform industrial relations to ensure fair wages and safe working conditions. Support unions and the award system, with democratic secret ballots to give workers real negotiating power without employer intimidation.

### **Deliver Free Childcare for Families**

Provide free or affordable childcare on a sliding scale based on income, removing financial barriers so parents can work without sacrificing their children’s care and development.

### **Bring Dental and Mental Health Into Medicare**

Expand universal healthcare to include dental and mental health services. Treat them as essential healthcare, not luxury services only the wealthy can afford.

### **Fix Aged Care With Dignity**

Improve aged care standards and increase funding so every older Australian receives quality care with dignity—free from neglect and abuse.

### **Cut Welfare Red Tape**

End Mutual Obligations and remove unnecessary red tape and tax traps in the welfare system. Streamline support through Universal Basic Income and end the punishing complexity that traps people in poverty.

### **End Forced Indue Cards**

Stop forcing welfare recipients to use the Indue Card—make it optional only. Respect people’s autonomy and dignity instead of treating them like children.

### **Reform the NDIS**

Remove profit-taking middlemen from the NDIS and strengthen disability support services so funding goes to people who need it, not corporate profits.

### **Fund Prevention, Not Just Treatment**

Make our health system cheaper and more effective by investing in prevention: mental health support, addiction services, and early-intervention programs that reduce long-term costs and save lives.

### **Deliver Free Vaccines for All**

Make vaccines free and accessible to everyone, with requirements only for caring professions where vulnerable people depend on protection. Public health should not depend on your bank balance—and prevention costs far less than treatment.

### **Guarantee Quality Education for Every Child**

Fund teachers and schools properly so they can deliver high-quality education for students of all backgrounds and abilities. Every Australian child deserves a great education regardless of postcode or disability.

### **Defend Free Speech**

Protect the freedom to criticise government and discuss the big issues in society. Maintain accountability for harmful speech; free expression is essential to democracy, but it does not mean freedom from consequences.

### **Legalise Voluntary Assisted Dying With Dignity**

Support voluntary assisted dying for terminally ill Australians, giving people control over their final days rather than forcing unnecessary suffering.

### **Lower the Voting Age to 16**

Introduce an optional voting age of 16 (with compulsory voting remaining at 18) and provide electoral education in high school so young Australians can participate in shaping their future.

### **Introduce an Australian Bill of Rights**

Create a Bill of Rights to protect fundamental freedoms in law, ensuring governments cannot erode basic rights without scrutiny.

### **Recognise First Nations in the Constitution**

Move forward as one united country. Recognise First Nations peoples in the Constitution and implement the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full.

### **Guarantee Equal Rights for LGBTIQA+ Partnerships**

Protect LGBTIQA+ rights and ensure equal legal standing for all partnerships and families. End discrimination in adoption, healthcare, and legal recognition.

# SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS

## Make Housing a Right, Not an Investment

### **Restructure the Housing Market**

Treat housing as a fundamental right, not an investment vehicle for the wealthy. Restructure the housing market so most people own only one home (the one they live in) and end policies that reward speculation while families struggle to afford housing.

### **End Negative Gearing Exploits**

Limit negative gearing to just one investment property per person or couple, stopping wealthy investors from building property empires on tax breaks. Close loopholes that let investors claim losses on multiple rental properties while pushing home ownership out of reach for ordinary Australians.

### **Supply Public Housing at Scale**

Deliver public and affordable housing at the scale the crisis demands—tens of thousands of homes, not token gestures.
Purchase one floor in every residential tower for public housing, integrating residents into city centres with access to jobs, transport, and services. This approach builds mixed communities, reduces isolation, and solves maintenance and security issues automatically through existing building services. It's an efficient way to increase public housing stock by 1-2% while ensuring people aren't isolated in housing ghettos far from opportunity.

### **Stop Exploitation by Landlords**

Regulate rental markets to protect tenants from unsafe conditions and no-grounds evictions. Raise and index rent assistance to 50% of actual rent paid so people are not trapped in poverty while landlords profit.

### **Scrap Capital Gains Concessions for Investors**

Remove the 50% capital gains tax discount on investment properties. This tax break rewards property speculators and encourages treating homes as get-rich-quick schemes instead of places for people to live. Replace it with a land value tax that makes hoarding empty properties expensive.

### **Build High-Speed Rail: Melbourne to Brisbane**

Deliver high-speed rail with strategic regional stops to create new affordable residential options and vibrant economic corridors. Fast rail opens up regional areas, connects people to jobs, eases pressure on capital cities, and gives families real choices about where to live.

### **Implement a Land Value Tax**

Shift the tax burden away from work and productivity toward land value, ensuring unearned windfalls are returned to the public and speculative behaviour is discouraged.
