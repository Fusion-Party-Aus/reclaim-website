# Fix Our Systems, Fix Our Country

*Our country became prosperous because we developed systems that incentivised <u>long-term</u> economic growth.*
*Over the past 50 years, those systems have been steadily dismantled dismantled and replaced with ones that incentivise <u>short-term</u> gains instead.*
*Growth continued for a while - not because the systems were good, but because of the cultural legacy which shaped our expectations and decisions.*

*But cultural legacy is temporary.*
*It evolves from generation to generation, and changes as we adapt to the world around us.*
*Now that legacy has been diluted to the point that long-term growth is no longer an outcome of our systems.*

*This is not the fault of the youth, nor the immigrant, nor the retiree.*

*It is the fault of an ultra-wealthy minority who used their influence over government to bend our systems to their own advantage.*

*And we cannot just go backwards. The systems of the past will not work again in the present, the world has changed too much.*

*We must Rebuild systems that generate long-term growth from first principles.*
*We must Reclaim our economy for the benefit of our future generations.*

*Fix our systems, fix our country.*
*It is the only way.*

**Australia will not secure its future until we fix the systems that reward short-term gain at the expense of long-term prosperity.**

# RECLAIM OUR ECONOMY

## Restore the Fair Go

### **Deliver UBI / Citizen’s Dividend for All Australians**

1. Every Australian will receive a Citizens Dividend set at the Henderson Poverty Line, paid automatically and unconditionally, replacing existing baseline welfare payments.
    1. A reliable income foundation will support stability through job changes, illness, and economic transition.
    2. Personal autonomy and dignity will be restored by providing income support without surveillance, compliance, or conditionality.
    3. Administrative simplicity and clarity will be achieved by consolidating fragmented welfare programs into a single universal payment.
    4. Broader participation in Australia’s economic prosperity will result from universal access to a baseline level of support.
    5. Adaptation to AI-driven labour change will be strengthened by separating basic economic security from full-time employment.

**Design rationale**  
A Universal Basic Income was selected over expanded conditional welfare and negative income tax models because it establishes a clear, permanent income floor without eligibility churn, behavioural conditions, or ongoing recalibration. Conditional and targeted systems were assessed as structurally complex, exclusion-prone, and poorly suited to labour-market volatility. The design intent is to provide a stable baseline that does not require frequent policy intervention as economic conditions change.

**System interaction**  
The Citizens Dividend replaces baseline income-support payments that provide subsistence-level income, while leaving supplementary and needs-based supports intact. Payments related to disability, caring responsibilities, housing assistance, or additional costs remain layered above the baseline. Interaction with the tax system occurs through ordinary income taxation rather than withdrawal rules, avoiding sharp cliffs and preserving universality.

**Economic and institutional logic**  
The policy alters incentive structures by separating basic income security from continuous employment. This reduces effective marginal tax rates created by benefit withdrawal, increases flexibility around part-time work, retraining, caregiving, and entrepreneurship, and improves worker bargaining position without relying on compliance enforcement. The design assumes that labour participation is primarily driven by income above subsistence levels, job quality, and social participation rather than coercive welfare conditionality.

**Risk and failure modes**  
Key risks include fiscal miscalibration if the baseline level is poorly set, political pressure to reintroduce conditionality that erodes universality, inflationary pressure if introduced without complementary supply-side reforms, and partial implementation that preserves complexity while losing coherence. Indicators of underperformance would include persistent poverty despite rollout, re-emergence of multiple overlapping income tests, or labour-market responses that significantly deviate from modelling assumptions.

**Evidence and precedent**  
Relevant evidence includes international income-floor pilots, negative income tax experiments, Australian basic-income modelling, and long-standing universal payment frameworks such as pensions and family benefits. Results consistently show strong poverty-reduction effects and administrative simplification, with labour-market impacts varying by design scale, interaction with taxation, and surrounding economic conditions. No single trial is treated as decisive; the policy draws on converging findings across multiple approaches.

**Implementation outline**  
Implementation is sequenced around legislative consolidation of baseline payments, integration with existing tax and reporting systems, and a managed transition period to prevent duplication or income gaps. Dependencies include accurate income data flows, agency coordination, and clear separation between baseline and supplementary supports. Detailed operational delivery is handled through a separate Delivery Plan document.

### **Build Fair and Stable Labour Markets**

1. Labour market rules will be restructured by establishing sector-level bargaining councils, enabling binding multi-employer wage agreements, requiring democratic governance and representation thresholds for worker organisations (including unions), and expanding the authority of the Fair Work Commission to coordinate, extend, and enforce wage and condition standards across industries.

   1. Wage outcomes will reflect productivity, skills, and conditions rather than desperation or fragmentation.
   2. Employers will compete on efficiency, innovation, and job quality instead of labour undercutting.
   3. Labour markets will become more stable as industry-wide standards reduce churn and arbitrage.
   4. Collective bargaining will operate as a coordination mechanism rather than a survival tool.
   5. The benefits of Universal Basic Income will flow to workers and communities rather than being captured through downward wage pressure.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**
With Universal Basic Income in place, workers are no longer compelled to accept poor pay or conditions to meet basic needs. Wage-setting institutions are therefore required to coordinate labour prices across sectors, not to protect workers from hardship.

**System interaction**
This reform operates alongside UBI by shaping wage outcomes in the labour market without substituting for income security. Unions and other worker organisations represent workers within sector-level bargaining councils, while the Fair Work Commission provides coordination, certification, and enforcement.

**Economic and institutional logic**
In a voluntary labour market, coordination prevents a race to the bottom between employers and ensures that bargaining power translates into economy-wide outcomes rather than isolated wins or losses.

**Risk and failure modes**
Risks include institutional capture, weak representation governance, or excessive rigidity across diverse sectors. Failure would appear as persistent wage suppression or instability despite strong labour demand.

**Evidence and precedent**
High-income economies with sector-level wage coordination show stronger middle-income growth, lower inequality, and more resilient labour markets when combined with robust income security.

**Implementation outline**
Implementation focuses on legislative recognition of sector-level bargaining councils, accreditation and governance standards for representative bodies, and expanded coordination powers for the Fair Work Commission, with detailed delivery handled through industrial relations legislation.

### **Simplify Access to Supplementary Supports**

1. Administrative processes for non-income supports such as disability, housing, and family assistance will be streamlined and standardised across agencies.
   1. Access to additional support will become faster and more predictable.
   2. Administrative duplication across government services will be reduced.
   3. Errors and access barriers caused by fragmented systems will decline.
   4. Support services will better reflect real-world needs and circumstances.

<details> <summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**
While UBI simplifies baseline income support, many Australians interact with multiple supplementary systems that remain fragmented, inconsistent, and administratively burdensome.

**System interaction**
This reform operates alongside UBI, explicitly excluding baseline income support and focusing on service-layer coordination across housing, disability, and family assistance.

**Economic and institutional logic**
Reducing administrative friction improves service effectiveness without increasing payment levels, delivering efficiency gains through coordination rather than conditionality.

**Risk and failure modes**
Risks include uneven agency adoption and data-sharing constraints. Underperformance would show up as continued duplication or delays despite reform.

**Implementation outline**
Cross-agency process review, standardisation of eligibility interfaces, and shared data infrastructure, with detailed execution handled through service delivery planning.

### **End Forced Indue Cards**

1. Welfare payment recipients will no longer be required to use Indue cards, with the option remaining voluntary.

   1. Individual autonomy over financial decisions will increase.
   2. Stigma associated with payment controls will decline.
   3. Welfare delivery will better respect personal agency.
   4. Support systems will become more flexible and humane.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**
Mandatory payment controls have not demonstrated systemic benefits proportional to their social and administrative costs.

**System interaction**
This alters payment delivery without changing eligibility or payment levels.

**Economic and institutional logic**
Removing coercive controls does not alter fiscal flows while improving user experience.

**Risk and failure modes**
Risks are limited to transitional administration. Monitoring focuses on voluntary uptake patterns.

**Implementation outline**
Regulatory change to payment conditions and provider communication.

### **Bring Dental and Mental Health Into Medicare**

1. Medicare coverage will be expanded to include basic dental care and comprehensive mental health services delivered through existing public health infrastructure.

   1. Access to essential health services will become more equitable.
   2. Preventative care will reduce long-term health system costs.
   3. Treatment gaps caused by cost barriers will narrow.
   4. Early intervention will improve health and productivity outcomes.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**
Excluding dental and mental health from universal healthcare creates avoidable disparities and downstream health costs.

**System interaction**
The expansion builds on existing Medicare billing, bulk-billing, and telehealth systems rather than creating parallel programs.

**Economic and institutional logic**
Preventative and early treatment reduces acute care demand and long-term system strain.

**Risk and failure modes**
Risks include provider capacity constraints and uneven uptake. Failure indicators include continued unmet care needs.

**Evidence and precedent**
Universal coverage models demonstrate reduced long-term costs and improved population health outcomes.

**Implementation outline**
Service inclusion staged by care type alongside provider incentive alignment.

### **Fix Aged Care With Dignity**

1. Aged care funding and regulation will be restructured to enforce quality standards, improve workforce conditions, and strengthen oversight and accountability.

   1. Care quality for older Australians will improve consistently across providers.
   2. Workforce stability will increase through better pay and conditions.
   3. Transparency and accountability will reduce neglect and abuse.
   4. Public confidence in aged care services will be restored.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**
Systemic failures in aged care reflect misaligned incentives, underfunding, and weak regulatory enforcement.

**System interaction**
This aligns aged care with health and social support systems to improve continuity and oversight.

**Economic and institutional logic**
Higher-quality care reduces acute health interventions and long-term public costs.

**Risk and failure modes**
Risks include workforce shortages and uneven compliance. Performance will be tracked through quality audits and outcomes.

**Evidence and precedent**
Findings from national inquiries consistently identify funding and accountability as decisive factors in care quality.

**Implementation outline**
Funding recalibration, regulatory strengthening, and staged compliance enforcement.

### **Deliver Free or Affordable Childcare for Families**

1. Childcare will be provided as a publicly funded universal service with income-adjusted fees, expanded capacity, strengthened workforce quality, higher staff-to-child ratios, and consistent national regulation and oversight.

   1. Workforce participation will increase as childcare affordability and availability improve.
   2. Children’s safety, development, and learning outcomes will improve through professional qualifications and better staff-to-child ratios.
   3. Families will experience greater economic security and flexibility when childcare is reliable, affordable, and consistent.
   4. Workforce stability and service quality will increase with better pay, career pathways, and conditions for early childhood educators.
   5. Regulatory transparency and enforcement will improve public trust and safety across all services.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**
Australia’s childcare sector has structural failures spanning affordability, workforce sustainability, safety, and governance. Academics and experts have called for bold, coordinated reforms to rebuild trust and system quality as part of a national early childhood education strategy. These reforms must address both cost and the foundational capacity of the sector to deliver safe, high-quality care.

**System interaction**
This reform integrates with the National Quality Framework, aligning universal access with minimum qualifications for staff, educator-to-child ratios, national quality assessments, and stronger regulatory oversight through bodies such as the Australian Children’s Education & Care Quality Authority.

**Workforce quality and pay**
A critical component is lifting workforce conditions. Government programs that have funded wage increases have demonstrated a scalable model for improving compensation and retention.

**Staff-to-child ratios and training**
Experts recommend lowering ratios from 1:4 to 1:3 for children under two, ensuring a qualified teacher is present in every room and improving monitoring of ratio compliance. High staffing ratios support both safety and developmental outcomes, especially in community and early learning environments.

**Safety, regulation, and oversight**
Widespread incidents of regulatory non-compliance and safety failures, including cases of abuse and inadequate working-with-children checks, highlight the need for more frequent quality assessments (e.g., at least once every three years), stronger enforcement powers, and better-resourced regulators.

**Economic and institutional logic**
Universal childcare expands labour participation by reducing cost barriers, while workforce professionalisation and regulatory quality produce safer, more consistent services. When educator pay reflects the value and complexity of the work, retention improves and services spend less on turnover and recruitment.

**Risk and failure modes**
Without workforce reform, expanded access can strain an already fragile system. Risks include continued understaffing, burnout, inconsistent quality across regions and provider types, and safety lapses. Ongoing monitoring must include ratio compliance, quality ratings, educator qualifications, and safety incident metrics.

**Evidence and precedent**
Sector-wide expert plans advocate international best practice: universal access models with strong workforce pay and training structures, reliable quality metrics, and independent oversight. These models show improved outcomes for children, parents, and workers alike.

**Implementation outline**
Phased expansion includes:

* Legislating universal service access with income-adjusted fees.
* Establishing statutory minimum staff qualifications and professional pathways.
* Setting stronger minima for staff-to-child ratios, particularly for early years.
* Resourcing regulatory authorities for regular quality assessments, unannounced inspections, and enforcement capacity.
* Coordinating wage improvement programs and retention incentives for educators.
* Detailed delivery planning, including legislative sequencing and intergovernmental coordination, is contained in a separate implementation plan.

# SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS

## Make Housing a Right, Not an Investment

### **Restructure the Housing Market**

Treat housing as a fundamental right, not an investment vehicle for the wealthy. Restructure the housing market so most people own only one home (the one they live in) and end policies that reward speculation while families struggle to afford housing.

### **End Negative Gearing Exploits**

Limit negative gearing to just one investment property per person or couple, stopping wealthy investors from building property empires on tax breaks. Close loopholes that let investors claim losses on multiple rental properties while pushing home ownership out of reach for ordinary Australians.

### **Supply Public Housing at Scale**

Deliver public and affordable housing at the scale the crisis demands—tens of thousands of homes, not token gestures.
Purchase one floor in every residential tower for public housing, integrating residents into city centres with access to jobs, transport, and services. This approach builds mixed communities, reduces isolation, and solves maintenance and security issues automatically through existing building services. It's an efficient way to increase public housing stock by 1-2% while ensuring people aren't isolated in housing ghettos far from opportunity.

### **Stop Exploitation by Landlords**

Regulate rental markets to protect tenants from unsafe conditions and no-grounds evictions. Raise and index rent assistance to 50% of actual rent paid so people are not trapped in poverty while landlords profit.

### **Scrap Capital Gains Concessions for Investors**

Remove the 50% capital gains tax discount on investment properties. This tax break rewards property speculators and encourages treating homes as get-rich-quick schemes instead of places for people to live. Replace it with a land value tax that makes hoarding empty properties expensive.

### **Build High-Speed Rail: Melbourne to Brisbane**

Deliver high-speed rail with strategic regional stops to create new affordable residential options and vibrant economic corridors. Fast rail opens up regional areas, connects people to jobs, eases pressure on capital cities, and gives families real choices about where to live.

### **Implement a Land Value Tax**

Shift the tax burden away from work and productivity toward land value, ensuring unearned windfalls are returned to the public and speculative behaviour is discouraged.
