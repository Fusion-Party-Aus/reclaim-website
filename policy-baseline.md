# Fix Our Systems, Fix Our Country

*Our country became prosperous because we developed systems that incentivised <u>long-term</u> economic growth.*
*Over the past 50 years, those systems have been steadily dismantled dismantled and replaced with ones that incentivise <u>short-term</u> gains instead.*
*Growth continued for a while - not because the systems were good, but because of the cultural legacy which shaped our expectations and decisions.*

*But cultural legacy is temporary.*
*It evolves from generation to generation, and changes as we adapt to the world around us.*
*Now that legacy has been diluted to the point that long-term growth is no longer an outcome of our systems.*

*This is not the fault of the youth, nor the immigrant, nor the retiree.*

*It is the fault of an ultra-wealthy minority who used their influence over government to bend our systems to their own advantage.*

*And we cannot just go backwards. The systems of the past will not work again in the present, the world has changed too much.*

*We must Rebuild systems that generate long-term growth from first principles.*
*We must Reclaim our economy for the benefit of our future generations.*

*Fix our systems, fix our country.*
*It is the only way.*

**Australia will not secure its future until we fix the systems that reward short-term gain at the expense of long-term prosperity.**

# RECLAIM OUR ECONOMY

## Restore the Fair Go

### **Deliver UBI / Citizen’s Dividend for All Australians**

1. Every Australian will receive a Citizens Dividend set at the Henderson Poverty Line, paid automatically and unconditionally, replacing existing baseline welfare payments.
    1. A reliable income foundation will support stability through job changes, illness, and economic transition.
    2. Personal autonomy and dignity will be restored by providing income support without surveillance, compliance, or conditionality.
    3. Administrative simplicity and clarity will be achieved by consolidating fragmented welfare programs into a single universal payment.
    4. Broader participation in Australia’s economic prosperity will result from universal access to a baseline level of support.
    5. Adaptation to AI-driven labour change will be strengthened by separating basic economic security from full-time employment.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**  
A Universal Basic Income was selected over expanded conditional welfare and negative income tax models because it establishes a clear, permanent income floor without eligibility churn, behavioural conditions, or ongoing recalibration. Conditional and targeted systems were assessed as structurally complex, exclusion-prone, and poorly suited to labour-market volatility. The design intent is to provide a stable baseline that does not require frequent policy intervention as economic conditions change.

**System interaction**  
The Citizens Dividend replaces baseline income-support payments that provide subsistence-level income, while leaving supplementary and needs-based supports intact. Payments related to disability, caring responsibilities, housing assistance, or additional costs remain layered above the baseline. Interaction with the tax system occurs through ordinary income taxation rather than withdrawal rules, avoiding sharp cliffs and preserving universality.

**Economic and institutional logic**  
The policy alters incentive structures by separating basic income security from continuous employment. This reduces effective marginal tax rates created by benefit withdrawal, increases flexibility around part-time work, retraining, caregiving, and entrepreneurship, and improves worker bargaining position without relying on compliance enforcement. The design assumes that labour participation is primarily driven by income above subsistence levels, job quality, and social participation rather than coercive welfare conditionality.

**Risk and failure modes**  
Key risks include fiscal miscalibration if the baseline level is poorly set, political pressure to reintroduce conditionality that erodes universality, inflationary pressure if introduced without complementary supply-side reforms, and partial implementation that preserves complexity while losing coherence. Indicators of underperformance would include persistent poverty despite rollout, re-emergence of multiple overlapping income tests, or labour-market responses that significantly deviate from modelling assumptions.

**Evidence and precedent**  
Relevant evidence includes international income-floor pilots, negative income tax experiments, Australian basic-income modelling, and long-standing universal payment frameworks such as pensions and family benefits. Results consistently show strong poverty-reduction effects and administrative simplification, with labour-market impacts varying by design scale, interaction with taxation, and surrounding economic conditions. No single trial is treated as decisive; the policy draws on converging findings across multiple approaches.

**Implementation outline**  
Implementation is sequenced around legislative consolidation of baseline payments, integration with existing tax and reporting systems, and a managed transition period to prevent duplication or income gaps. Dependencies include accurate income data flows, agency coordination, and clear separation between baseline and supplementary supports. Detailed operational delivery is handled through a separate Delivery Plan document.

### **Build Fair and Stable Labour Markets**

1. Labour market rules will be restructured by establishing sector-level bargaining councils, enabling binding multi-employer wage agreements, requiring democratic governance and representation thresholds for worker organisations (including unions), and expanding the authority of the Fair Work Commission to coordinate, extend, and enforce wage and condition standards across industries.

   1. Wage outcomes will reflect productivity, skills, and conditions rather than desperation or fragmentation.
   2. Employers will compete on efficiency, innovation, and job quality instead of labour undercutting.
   3. Labour markets will become more stable as industry-wide standards reduce churn and arbitrage.
   4. Collective bargaining will operate as a coordination mechanism rather than a survival tool.
   5. The benefits of Universal Basic Income will flow to workers and communities rather than being captured through downward wage pressure.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**
With Universal Basic Income in place, workers are no longer compelled to accept poor pay or conditions to meet basic needs. Wage-setting institutions are therefore required to coordinate labour prices across sectors, not to protect workers from hardship.

**System interaction**
This reform operates alongside UBI by shaping wage outcomes in the labour market without substituting for income security. Unions and other worker organisations represent workers within sector-level bargaining councils, while the Fair Work Commission provides coordination, certification, and enforcement.

**Economic and institutional logic**
In a voluntary labour market, coordination prevents a race to the bottom between employers and ensures that bargaining power translates into economy-wide outcomes rather than isolated wins or losses.

**Risk and failure modes**
Risks include institutional capture, weak representation governance, or excessive rigidity across diverse sectors. Failure would appear as persistent wage suppression or instability despite strong labour demand.

**Evidence and precedent**
High-income economies with sector-level wage coordination show stronger middle-income growth, lower inequality, and more resilient labour markets when combined with robust income security.

**Implementation outline**
Implementation focuses on legislative recognition of sector-level bargaining councils, accreditation and governance standards for representative bodies, and expanded coordination powers for the Fair Work Commission, with detailed delivery handled through industrial relations legislation.

### **Simplify Access to Supplementary Supports**

1. Administrative processes for non-income supports such as disability, housing, and family assistance will be streamlined and standardised across agencies.
   1. Access to additional support will become faster and more predictable.
   2. Administrative duplication across government services will be reduced.
   3. Errors and access barriers caused by fragmented systems will decline.
   4. Support services will better reflect real-world needs and circumstances.

<details> <summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**
While UBI simplifies baseline income support, many Australians interact with multiple supplementary systems that remain fragmented, inconsistent, and administratively burdensome.

**System interaction**
This reform operates alongside UBI, explicitly excluding baseline income support and focusing on service-layer coordination across housing, disability, and family assistance.

**Economic and institutional logic**
Reducing administrative friction improves service effectiveness without increasing payment levels, delivering efficiency gains through coordination rather than conditionality.

**Risk and failure modes**
Risks include uneven agency adoption and data-sharing constraints. Underperformance would show up as continued duplication or delays despite reform.

**Implementation outline**
Cross-agency process review, standardisation of eligibility interfaces, and shared data infrastructure, with detailed execution handled through service delivery planning.

</details>

### **End Forced Indue Cards**

1. Welfare payment recipients will no longer be required to use Indue cards, with the option remaining voluntary.

   1. Individual autonomy over financial decisions will increase.
   2. Stigma associated with payment controls will decline.
   3. Welfare delivery will better respect personal agency.
   4. Support systems will become more flexible and humane.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**
Mandatory payment controls have not demonstrated systemic benefits proportional to their social and administrative costs.

**System interaction**
This alters payment delivery without changing eligibility or payment levels.

**Economic and institutional logic**
Removing coercive controls does not alter fiscal flows while improving user experience.

**Risk and failure modes**
Risks are limited to transitional administration. Monitoring focuses on voluntary uptake patterns.

**Implementation outline**
Regulatory change to payment conditions and provider communication.

</details>

### **Bring Dental and Mental Health Into Medicare**

1. Medicare coverage will be expanded to include basic dental care and comprehensive mental health services delivered through existing public health infrastructure.

   1. Access to essential health services will become more equitable.
   2. Preventative care will reduce long-term health system costs.
   3. Treatment gaps caused by cost barriers will narrow.
   4. Early intervention will improve health and productivity outcomes.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**
Excluding dental and mental health from universal healthcare creates avoidable disparities and downstream health costs.

**System interaction**
The expansion builds on existing Medicare billing, bulk-billing, and telehealth systems rather than creating parallel programs.

**Economic and institutional logic**
Preventative and early treatment reduces acute care demand and long-term system strain.

**Risk and failure modes**
Risks include provider capacity constraints and uneven uptake. Failure indicators include continued unmet care needs.

**Evidence and precedent**
Universal coverage models demonstrate reduced long-term costs and improved population health outcomes.

**Implementation outline**
Service inclusion staged by care type alongside provider incentive alignment.

---
</details>

### **Fix Aged Care With Dignity**

1. Aged care funding and regulation will be restructured to enforce quality standards, improve workforce conditions, and strengthen oversight and accountability.

   1. Care quality for older Australians will improve consistently across providers.
   2. Workforce stability will increase through better pay and conditions.
   3. Transparency and accountability will reduce neglect and abuse.
   4. Public confidence in aged care services will be restored.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**
Systemic failures in aged care reflect misaligned incentives, underfunding, and weak regulatory enforcement.

**System interaction**
This aligns aged care with health and social support systems to improve continuity and oversight.

**Economic and institutional logic**
Higher-quality care reduces acute health interventions and long-term public costs.

**Risk and failure modes**
Risks include workforce shortages and uneven compliance. Performance will be tracked through quality audits and outcomes.

**Evidence and precedent**
Findings from national inquiries consistently identify funding and accountability as decisive factors in care quality.

**Implementation outline**
Funding recalibration, regulatory strengthening, and staged compliance enforcement.

### **Deliver Free or Affordable Childcare for Families**

1. Childcare will be provided as a publicly funded universal service with income-adjusted fees, expanded capacity, strengthened workforce quality, higher staff-to-child ratios, and consistent national regulation and oversight.

   1. Workforce participation will increase as childcare affordability and availability improve.
   2. Children’s safety, development, and learning outcomes will improve through professional qualifications and better staff-to-child ratios.
   3. Families will experience greater economic security and flexibility when childcare is reliable, affordable, and consistent.
   4. Workforce stability and service quality will increase with better pay, career pathways, and conditions for early childhood educators.
   5. Regulatory transparency and enforcement will improve public trust and safety across all services.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**
Australia’s childcare sector has structural failures spanning affordability, workforce sustainability, safety, and governance. Academics and experts have called for bold, coordinated reforms to rebuild trust and system quality as part of a national early childhood education strategy. These reforms must address both cost and the foundational capacity of the sector to deliver safe, high-quality care.

**System interaction**
This reform integrates with the National Quality Framework, aligning universal access with minimum qualifications for staff, educator-to-child ratios, national quality assessments, and stronger regulatory oversight through bodies such as the Australian Children’s Education & Care Quality Authority.

**Workforce quality and pay**
A critical component is lifting workforce conditions. Government programs that have funded wage increases have demonstrated a scalable model for improving compensation and retention.

**Staff-to-child ratios and training**
Experts recommend lowering ratios from 1:4 to 1:3 for children under two, ensuring a qualified teacher is present in every room and improving monitoring of ratio compliance. High staffing ratios support both safety and developmental outcomes, especially in community and early learning environments.

**Safety, regulation, and oversight**
Widespread incidents of regulatory non-compliance and safety failures, including cases of abuse and inadequate working-with-children checks, highlight the need for more frequent quality assessments (e.g., at least once every three years), stronger enforcement powers, and better-resourced regulators.

**Economic and institutional logic**
Universal childcare expands labour participation by reducing cost barriers, while workforce professionalisation and regulatory quality produce safer, more consistent services. When educator pay reflects the value and complexity of the work, retention improves and services spend less on turnover and recruitment.

**Risk and failure modes**
Without workforce reform, expanded access can strain an already fragile system. Risks include continued understaffing, burnout, inconsistent quality across regions and provider types, and safety lapses. Ongoing monitoring must include ratio compliance, quality ratings, educator qualifications, and safety incident metrics.

**Evidence and precedent**
Sector-wide expert plans advocate international best practice: universal access models with strong workforce pay and training structures, reliable quality metrics, and independent oversight. These models show improved outcomes for children, parents, and workers alike.

**Implementation outline**
Phased expansion includes:

* Legislating universal service access with income-adjusted fees.
* Establishing statutory minimum staff qualifications and professional pathways.
* Setting stronger minima for staff-to-child ratios, particularly for early years.
* Resourcing regulatory authorities for regular quality assessments, unannounced inspections, and enforcement capacity.
* Coordinating wage improvement programs and retention incentives for educators.
* Detailed delivery planning, including legislative sequencing and intergovernmental coordination, is contained in a separate implementation plan.

# SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS

## Make Housing a Right, Not an Investment
(Distortion → Correction → Production → Completion)

### **Make It Easier to Buy and Move Home**

1. Implement a nationally consistent Land Value Tax framework that applies by default, abolishes residential stamp duty, and requires a broad land-only tax base, while allowing states to displace the federal tax by adopting a structurally compliant system of their own.

    1. Housing mobility will increase as Australians can move without punitive upfront costs.
    2. Entry costs for first-home buyers will fall as taxation shifts away from lump-sum purchase barriers.
    3. Families will be able to right-size their homes more easily as financial penalties for moving decline.
    4. State revenue will stabilise through recurring land-based collections rather than volatile transaction cycles.
    5. Public infrastructure investment will translate into shared community benefit rather than private windfall gains.
    6. Housing prices will align more closely with construction value and genuine demand rather than speculative scarcity.
    7. Under-utilised and vacant land will return to productive use as land is put to work rather than held idle.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**  
Stamp duty functions as a transaction barrier that suppresses mobility and distorts land allocation. Replacing transfer-based taxation with recurring land taxation corrects the structural incentive to hold land passively while reducing movement penalties.

**Structural framework**  
The Commonwealth legislation establishes:
- A mandatory land-only valuation base (excluding improvements).
- Universal application across residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural land categories.
- Prohibition of residential transaction taxes once a compliant land tax is in place.

The default federal rate applies nationally unless displaced by a compliant state regime.

**Displacement mechanism**  
A state may displace the federal tax only if:
1. Residential stamp duty is fully abolished.
2. The land tax applies to a broad base without structural exemptions.
3. Valuation methodology excludes improvements.
4. No state-imposed tax is levied on buildings, structures, or capital improvements.
5. No substitute transaction tax is introduced under another name.

Rate levels remain within state control. Structural design does not.

**Transition treatment for households**  
Stamp duty paid within the prior holding period is credited against future land value tax liabilities until exhausted, preventing double burden during transition.

**Tax base guardrails**  
- No principal-place-of-residence carve-out beyond defined transitional offsets.
- No category-based structural exemptions.
- No land banking exclusions.
- Agricultural land remains included unless constitutionally constrained.

**Economic logic**  
Recurring land taxation reduces lock-in effects, applies consistent holding costs to vacancy, and aligns revenue collection with long-term land value rather than market turnover cycles.

**Risk and failure modes**  
System integrity depends on maintaining a broad base and resisting exemption creep. Dilution through carve-outs, rate arbitrage, or reintroduced transaction levies would undermine effectiveness.

**Implementation outline**  
Federal legislation establishes the default system and certification process. States may assume administration upon structural compliance. Intergovernmental coordination standardises land valuation practices across jurisdictions.

### **Make Housing Tax Fair Across Generations**

1. Replace the 50% Capital Gains Tax discount with inflation indexation of the cost base for newly acquired assets, and apply stricter CGT treatment to investment housing so gains reflect real value creation rather than a tax-favoured windfall.

    1. Younger Australians will face a fairer market when competing with tax-advantaged capital gains strategies.
    2. Investment returns will reflect real gains after inflation rather than an automatic discount.
    3. Capital will flow more readily toward productive investment when housing is less tax-favoured as a wealth vehicle.
    4. Public revenue will strengthen as large untaxed gains are reduced in the base.
    5. Speculative “buy-and-hold for the discount” strategies will lose their edge as preferential treatment is removed.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**  
Australia moved from CGT indexation to a flat discount model in 1999. Indexation targets the core fairness question—taxing real gains rather than inflation—without granting an automatic windfall discount unrelated to inflation.

**Indexation precedent and current-law context**  
For certain pre-1999 assets, Australian tax law still allows indexation as an alternative to the discount, demonstrating that indexation is an established concept in the system.

**Structural limits**  
1. For assets acquired after the start date, the CGT discount is not available; the cost base is indexed for inflation using a defined indexation factor.  
2. Investment housing receives the tightened treatment first, reflecting its outsized role in speculation incentives.  
3. Transitional treatment is defined by acquisition date (grandfathering rules) to avoid retroactive taxation shocks.  
4. Integrity rules apply to prevent asset re-characterisation and wash-sale behaviour around the start date.

**Evidence and live policy discussion**  
Recent Parliamentary Budget Office costing work explicitly models replacing the CGT discount with cost-base indexation for non-property assets while removing the discount for investment properties under defined conditions, indicating indexation is being actively considered in contemporary reform design.

**Risk and failure modes**  
Risks include lock-in effects if poorly designed, or loopholes that preserve the discount’s effect through alternative concessions. Success depends on tight start-date rules and integrity provisions.

**Implementation outline**  
Implementation is delivered through amendments to CGT discount provisions, indexation factor definitions, transitional acquisition-date rules, and compliance guidance to support consistent application.

</details>

### **Stop Housing Being a Speculation Game**

1. Restrict negative gearing for housing so rental losses cannot be used to reduce tax on wages and salaries, with loss deductions quarantined to future rental income and capital gains within the housing portfolio.

    1. First-home buyers will face less investor bid pressure when purchasing established homes.
    2. Investment choices will shift toward rental performance and genuine housing demand rather than paper losses.
    3. Household finances will become more resilient as the tax system rewards sustainable returns instead of leverage.
    4. Government revenue will become more reliable as housing losses stop eroding the income tax base.
    5. Tax-driven property accumulation strategies will become less attractive than productive investment elsewhere.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**  
Negative gearing amplifies leveraged demand for existing dwellings by allowing losses to be offset against unrelated income. Quarantining losses keeps legitimate investment deductions available, while removing the incentive to run persistent losses primarily for tax advantage.

**Displacement and interaction with other reforms**  
This reform is designed to work alongside the Land Value Tax replacement of stamp duty and CGT reform. Together, they reduce speculative returns from holding existing dwellings and shift incentives toward productive use and new supply.

**Structural limits**  
1. Losses from residential rental property may not be deducted against wages and salaries.  
2. Losses are quarantined and may be applied only against future rental income or realised capital gains from residential property.  
3. The rule applies across individuals and pass-through entities commonly used for housing investment (trusts/partnership structures) to prevent simple routing avoidance.

**Risk and failure modes**  
Risks include avoidance via reclassification of expenses or restructuring of ownership. Integrity depends on clear definitions of deductible rental losses and consistent application across entity types.

**Implementation outline**  
Implementation proceeds through tax law amendments establishing quarantining, transitional rules for existing carried-forward losses, and integrity provisions for common avoidance structures.

</details>

### **Shift Rezoning Gains to Benefit the Public**

1. Apply a windfall gains tax to land value uplifts created by government rezoning decisions, capturing a share of rezoning-created value for public benefit rather than leaving it as an unearned private gain.

    1. Infrastructure and services will be better funded as rezoning uplifts contribute to public value.
    2. Communities will see a fairer return from public decisions that create sudden land value jumps.
    3. Planning reform will become more credible when rezoning benefits are shared rather than concentrated.
    4. Land banking will become less attractive as rezoning windfalls are no longer fully private.
    5. Pure “wait for rezoning” strategies will lose payoff as unearned uplift is no longer fully private.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**  
Rezoning can create a sudden uplift in land value that is driven by public decision-making rather than owner effort. A windfall gains tax captures part of that uplift and aligns rezoning with public benefit.

**Existing Australian precedent**  
Victoria already operates a windfall gains tax model that applies when rezoning increases land value above a threshold, with options to defer payment under specified conditions.

**Structural limits**  
1. Liability is calculated only on the uplift attributable to rezoning (the rezoning-driven increase in land value).
2. A minimum uplift threshold applies before any tax is payable (threshold design follows the precedent model).
3. Deferral is permitted under defined conditions with interest, to reduce cash-flow shock while preserving collection integrity.
4. The value of the tax is calculated at rezoning decision points and indexed until final sale, so windfalls are captured even when land is held.

**Risk and failure modes**  
Risks include valuation disputes, gaming around rezoning boundaries, or political pressure for exemptions. Integrity depends on valuation transparency and consistent uplift attribution.

**Implementation outline**  
Implementation requires a valuation method for pre- and post-rezoning land values, uplift assessment notices, a structured deferral pathway, and a clear interaction rule with Land Value Tax so the two taxes do not duplicate the same base at the same event.

### **Supply Public Housing at Scale**

Deliver public and affordable housing at the scale the crisis demands—tens of thousands of homes, not token gestures.
Purchase one floor in every residential tower for public housing, integrating residents into city centres with access to jobs, transport, and services. This approach builds mixed communities, reduces isolation, and solves maintenance and security issues automatically through existing building services. It's an efficient way to increase public housing stock by 1-2% while ensuring people aren't isolated in housing ghettos far from opportunity.

### **Stop Exploitation by Landlords**

Regulate rental markets to protect tenants from unsafe conditions and no-grounds evictions. Raise and index rent assistance to 50% of actual rent paid so people are not trapped in poverty while landlords profit.

### **Build High-Speed Rail: Melbourne to Brisbane**

Deliver high-speed rail with strategic regional stops to create new affordable residential options and vibrant economic corridors. Fast rail opens up regional areas, connects people to jobs, eases pressure on capital cities, and gives families real choices about where to live.
