# Fix Our Systems, Fix Our Country

*Our country became prosperous because we developed systems that incentivised <u>long-term</u> economic growth.*
*Over the past 50 years, those systems have been steadily dismantled dismantled and replaced with ones that incentivise <u>short-term</u> gains instead.*
*Growth continued for a while - not because the systems were good, but because of the cultural legacy which shaped our expectations and decisions.*

*But cultural legacy is temporary.*
*It evolves from generation to generation, and changes as we adapt to the world around us.*
*Now that legacy has been diluted to the point that long-term growth is no longer an outcome of our systems.*

*This is not the fault of the youth, nor the immigrant, nor the retiree.*

*It is the fault of an ultra-wealthy minority who used their influence over government to bend our systems to their own advantage.*

*And we cannot just go backwards. The systems of the past will not work again in the present, the world has changed too much.*

*We must Rebuild systems that generate long-term growth from first principles.*
*We must Reclaim our economy for the benefit of our future generations.*

*Fix our systems, fix our country.*
*It is the only way.*

**Australia will not secure its future until we fix the systems that reward short-term gain at the expense of long-term prosperity.**

# RECLAIM OUR ECONOMY

## Restore the Fair Go
Making Australia a country where your effort secures a stable income, essential services work when you need them, and prosperity is not reserved for those who were already born lucky.

### **Deliver UBI / Citizen’s Dividend for All Australians**

1. Every Australian will receive a Citizens Dividend set at the Henderson Poverty Line, paid automatically and unconditionally, replacing existing baseline welfare payments.
   1. A reliable income foundation will support stability through job changes, illness, and economic transition.
   2. Personal autonomy and dignity will be restored by providing income support without surveillance, compliance, or conditionality.
   3. Administrative simplicity and clarity will be achieved by consolidating fragmented welfare programs into a single universal payment.
   4. Broader participation in Australia’s economic prosperity will result from universal access to a baseline level of support.
   5. Adaptation to AI-driven labour change will be strengthened by separating basic economic security from full-time employment.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**  
A Universal Basic Income was selected over expanded conditional welfare and negative income tax models because it establishes a clear, permanent income floor without eligibility churn, behavioural conditions, or ongoing recalibration. Conditional and targeted systems were assessed as structurally complex, exclusion-prone, and poorly suited to labour-market volatility. The design intent is to provide a stable baseline that does not require frequent policy intervention as economic conditions change.

**System interaction**  
The Citizens Dividend replaces baseline income-support payments that provide subsistence-level income, while leaving supplementary and needs-based supports intact. Payments related to disability, caring responsibilities, housing assistance, or additional costs remain layered above the baseline. Interaction with the tax system occurs through ordinary income taxation rather than withdrawal rules, avoiding sharp cliffs and preserving universality.

**Economic and institutional logic**  
The policy alters incentive structures by separating basic income security from continuous employment. This reduces effective marginal tax rates created by benefit withdrawal, increases flexibility around part-time work, retraining, caregiving, and entrepreneurship, and improves worker bargaining position without relying on compliance enforcement. The design assumes that labour participation is primarily driven by income above subsistence levels, job quality, and social participation rather than coercive welfare conditionality.

**Risk and failure modes**  
Key risks include fiscal miscalibration if the baseline level is poorly set, political pressure to reintroduce conditionality that erodes universality, inflationary pressure if introduced without complementary supply-side reforms, and partial implementation that preserves complexity while losing coherence. Indicators of underperformance would include persistent poverty despite rollout, re-emergence of multiple overlapping income tests, or labour-market responses that significantly deviate from modelling assumptions.

**Evidence and precedent**  
Relevant evidence includes international income-floor pilots, negative income tax experiments, Australian basic-income modelling, and long-standing universal payment frameworks such as pensions and family benefits. Results consistently show strong poverty-reduction effects and administrative simplification, with labour-market impacts varying by design scale, interaction with taxation, and surrounding economic conditions. No single trial is treated as decisive; the policy draws on converging findings across multiple approaches.

**Implementation outline**  
Implementation is sequenced around legislative consolidation of baseline payments, integration with existing tax and reporting systems, and a managed transition period to prevent duplication or income gaps. Dependencies include accurate income data flows, agency coordination, and clear separation between baseline and supplementary supports. Detailed operational delivery is handled through a separate Delivery Plan document.

### **Build Fair and Stable Labour Markets**

1. Labour market rules will be restructured by establishing sector-level bargaining councils, enabling binding multi-employer wage agreements, requiring democratic governance and representation thresholds for worker organisations (including unions), and expanding the authority of the Fair Work Commission to coordinate, extend, and enforce wage and condition standards across industries.

   1. Wage outcomes will reflect productivity, skills, and conditions rather than desperation or fragmentation.
   2. Employers will compete on efficiency, innovation, and job quality instead of labour undercutting.
   3. Labour markets will become more stable as industry-wide standards reduce churn and arbitrage.
   4. Collective bargaining will operate as a coordination mechanism rather than a survival tool.
   5. The benefits of Universal Basic Income will flow to workers and communities rather than being captured through downward wage pressure.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**
With Universal Basic Income in place, workers are no longer compelled to accept poor pay or conditions to meet basic needs. Wage-setting institutions are therefore required to coordinate labour prices across sectors, not to protect workers from hardship.

**System interaction**
This reform operates alongside UBI by shaping wage outcomes in the labour market without substituting for income security. Unions and other worker organisations represent workers within sector-level bargaining councils, while the Fair Work Commission provides coordination, certification, and enforcement.

**Economic and institutional logic**
In a voluntary labour market, coordination prevents a race to the bottom between employers and ensures that bargaining power translates into economy-wide outcomes rather than isolated wins or losses.

**Risk and failure modes**
Risks include institutional capture, weak representation governance, or excessive rigidity across diverse sectors. Failure would appear as persistent wage suppression or instability despite strong labour demand.

**Evidence and precedent**
High-income economies with sector-level wage coordination show stronger middle-income growth, lower inequality, and more resilient labour markets when combined with robust income security.

**Implementation outline**
Implementation focuses on legislative recognition of sector-level bargaining councils, accreditation and governance standards for representative bodies, and expanded coordination powers for the Fair Work Commission, with detailed delivery handled through industrial relations legislation.

### **Simplify Access to Supplementary Supports**

1. Administrative processes for non-income supports such as disability, housing, and family assistance will be streamlined and standardised across agencies.
   1. Access to additional support will become faster and more predictable.
   2. Administrative duplication across government services will be reduced.
   3. Errors and access barriers caused by fragmented systems will decline.
   4. Support services will better reflect real-world needs and circumstances.

<details> <summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**
While UBI simplifies baseline income support, many Australians interact with multiple supplementary systems that remain fragmented, inconsistent, and administratively burdensome.

**System interaction**
This reform operates alongside UBI, explicitly excluding baseline income support and focusing on service-layer coordination across housing, disability, and family assistance.

**Economic and institutional logic**
Reducing administrative friction improves service effectiveness without increasing payment levels, delivering efficiency gains through coordination rather than conditionality.

**Risk and failure modes**
Risks include uneven agency adoption and data-sharing constraints. Underperformance would show up as continued duplication or delays despite reform.

**Implementation outline**
Cross-agency process review, standardisation of eligibility interfaces, and shared data infrastructure, with detailed execution handled through service delivery planning.

---
</details>

### **End Forced Indue Cards**

1. Welfare payment recipients will no longer be required to use Indue cards, with the option remaining voluntary.

   1. Individual autonomy over financial decisions will increase.
   2. Stigma associated with payment controls will decline.
   3. Welfare delivery will better respect personal agency.
   4. Support systems will become more flexible and humane.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**
Mandatory payment controls have not demonstrated systemic benefits proportional to their social and administrative costs.

**System interaction**
This alters payment delivery without changing eligibility or payment levels.

**Economic and institutional logic**
Removing coercive controls does not alter fiscal flows while improving user experience.

**Risk and failure modes**
Risks are limited to transitional administration. Monitoring focuses on voluntary uptake patterns.

**Implementation outline**
Regulatory change to payment conditions and provider communication.

---
</details>

### **Bring Dental and Mental Health Into Medicare**

1. Medicare coverage will be expanded to include basic dental care and comprehensive mental health services delivered through existing public health infrastructure.

   1. Access to essential health services will become more equitable.
   2. Preventative care will reduce long-term health system costs.
   3. Treatment gaps caused by cost barriers will narrow.
   4. Early intervention will improve health and productivity outcomes.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**
Excluding dental and mental health from universal healthcare creates avoidable disparities and downstream health costs.

**System interaction**
The expansion builds on existing Medicare billing, bulk-billing, and telehealth systems rather than creating parallel programs.

**Economic and institutional logic**
Preventative and early treatment reduces acute care demand and long-term system strain.

**Risk and failure modes**
Risks include provider capacity constraints and uneven uptake. Failure indicators include continued unmet care needs.

**Evidence and precedent**
Universal coverage models demonstrate reduced long-term costs and improved population health outcomes.

**Implementation outline**
Service inclusion staged by care type alongside provider incentive alignment.

---
</details>

### **Fix Aged Care With Dignity**

1. Aged care funding and regulation will be restructured to enforce quality standards, improve workforce conditions, and strengthen oversight and accountability.

   1. Care quality for older Australians will improve consistently across providers.
   2. Workforce stability will increase through better pay and conditions.
   3. Transparency and accountability will reduce neglect and abuse.
   4. Public confidence in aged care services will be restored.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**
Systemic failures in aged care reflect misaligned incentives, underfunding, and weak regulatory enforcement.

**System interaction**
This aligns aged care with health and social support systems to improve continuity and oversight.

**Economic and institutional logic**
Higher-quality care reduces acute health interventions and long-term public costs.

**Risk and failure modes**
Risks include workforce shortages and uneven compliance. Performance will be tracked through quality audits and outcomes.

**Evidence and precedent**
Findings from national inquiries consistently identify funding and accountability as decisive factors in care quality.

**Implementation outline**
Funding recalibration, regulatory strengthening, and staged compliance enforcement.

</details>

### **Deliver Free or Affordable Childcare for Families**

1. Childcare will be provided as a publicly funded universal service with income-adjusted fees, expanded capacity, strengthened workforce quality, higher staff-to-child ratios, and consistent national regulation and oversight.

   1. Workforce participation will increase as childcare affordability and availability improve.
   2. Children’s safety, development, and learning outcomes will improve through professional qualifications and better staff-to-child ratios.
   3. Families will experience greater economic security and flexibility when childcare is reliable, affordable, and consistent.
   4. Workforce stability and service quality will increase with better pay, career pathways, and conditions for early childhood educators.
   5. Regulatory transparency and enforcement will improve public trust and safety across all services.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**
Australia’s childcare sector has structural failures spanning affordability, workforce sustainability, safety, and governance. Academics and experts have called for bold, coordinated reforms to rebuild trust and system quality as part of a national early childhood education strategy. These reforms must address both cost and the foundational capacity of the sector to deliver safe, high-quality care.

**System interaction**
This reform integrates with the National Quality Framework, aligning universal access with minimum qualifications for staff, educator-to-child ratios, national quality assessments, and stronger regulatory oversight through bodies such as the Australian Children’s Education & Care Quality Authority.

**Workforce quality and pay**
A critical component is lifting workforce conditions. Government programs that have funded wage increases have demonstrated a scalable model for improving compensation and retention.

**Staff-to-child ratios and training**
Experts recommend lowering ratios from 1:4 to 1:3 for children under two, ensuring a qualified teacher is present in every room and improving monitoring of ratio compliance. High staffing ratios support both safety and developmental outcomes, especially in community and early learning environments.

**Safety, regulation, and oversight**
Widespread incidents of regulatory non-compliance and safety failures, including cases of abuse and inadequate working-with-children checks, highlight the need for more frequent quality assessments (e.g., at least once every three years), stronger enforcement powers, and better-resourced regulators.

**Economic and institutional logic**
Universal childcare expands labour participation by reducing cost barriers, while workforce professionalisation and regulatory quality produce safer, more consistent services. When educator pay reflects the value and complexity of the work, retention improves and services spend less on turnover and recruitment.

**Risk and failure modes**
Without workforce reform, expanded access can strain an already fragile system. Risks include continued understaffing, burnout, inconsistent quality across regions and provider types, and safety lapses. Ongoing monitoring must include ratio compliance, quality ratings, educator qualifications, and safety incident metrics.

**Evidence and precedent**
Sector-wide expert plans advocate international best practice: universal access models with strong workforce pay and training structures, reliable quality metrics, and independent oversight. These models show improved outcomes for children, parents, and workers alike.

**Implementation outline**
Phased expansion includes:

* Legislating universal service access with income-adjusted fees.
* Establishing statutory minimum staff qualifications and professional pathways.
* Setting stronger minima for staff-to-child ratios, particularly for early years.
* Resourcing regulatory authorities for regular quality assessments, unannounced inspections, and enforcement capacity.
* Coordinating wage improvement programs and retention incentives for educators.
* Detailed delivery planning, including legislative sequencing and intergovernmental coordination, is contained in a separate implementation plan.

## Solve the Housing Crisis
Making Australia a country where housing is a right, not an investment. Where ordinary Australians can find a secure, well-located home without being locked out by speculation, scarcity, or postcode privilege.

### **Make It Easier to Buy and Move Home**

1. Implement a nationally consistent Land Value Tax framework that applies by default, abolishes residential stamp duty, and requires a broad land-only tax base, while allowing states to displace the federal tax by adopting a structurally compliant system of their own.

   1. Housing mobility will increase as Australians can move without punitive upfront costs.
   2. Entry costs for first-home buyers will fall as taxation shifts away from lump-sum purchase barriers.
   3. Families will be able to right-size their homes more easily as financial penalties for moving decline.
   4. State revenue will stabilise through recurring land-based collections rather than volatile transaction cycles.
   5. Public infrastructure investment will translate into shared community benefit rather than private windfall gains.
   6. Housing prices will align more closely with construction value and genuine demand rather than speculative scarcity.
   7. Under-utilised and vacant land will return to productive use as land is put to work rather than held idle.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**  
Stamp duty functions as a transaction barrier that suppresses mobility and distorts land allocation. Replacing transfer-based taxation with recurring land taxation corrects the structural incentive to hold land passively while reducing movement penalties.

**Structural framework**  
The Commonwealth legislation establishes:
- A mandatory land-only valuation base (excluding improvements).
- Universal application across residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural land categories.
- Prohibition of residential transaction taxes once a compliant land tax is in place.

The default federal rate applies nationally unless displaced by a compliant state regime.

**Displacement mechanism**  
A state may displace the federal tax only if:
1. Residential stamp duty is fully abolished.
2. The land tax applies to a broad base without structural exemptions.
3. Valuation methodology excludes improvements.
4. No state-imposed tax is levied on buildings, structures, or capital improvements.
5. No substitute transaction tax is introduced under another name.

Rate levels remain within state control. Structural design does not.

**Transition treatment for households**  
Stamp duty paid within the prior holding period is credited against future land value tax liabilities until exhausted, preventing double burden during transition.

**Tax base guardrails**  
- No principal-place-of-residence carve-out beyond defined transitional offsets.
- No category-based structural exemptions.
- No land banking exclusions.
- Agricultural land remains included unless constitutionally constrained.

**Economic logic**  
Recurring land taxation reduces lock-in effects, applies consistent holding costs to vacancy, and aligns revenue collection with long-term land value rather than market turnover cycles.

**Risk and failure modes**  
System integrity depends on maintaining a broad base and resisting exemption creep. Dilution through carve-outs, rate arbitrage, or reintroduced transaction levies would undermine effectiveness.

**Implementation outline**  
Federal legislation establishes the default system and certification process. States may assume administration upon structural compliance. Intergovernmental coordination standardises land valuation practices across jurisdictions.

### **Make Housing Tax Fair Across Generations**

1. Replace the 50% Capital Gains Tax discount with inflation indexation of the cost base for newly acquired assets, and apply stricter CGT treatment to investment housing so gains reflect real value creation rather than a tax-favoured windfall.

   1. Younger Australians will face a fairer market when competing with tax-advantaged capital gains strategies.
   2. Investment returns will reflect real gains after inflation rather than an automatic discount.
   3. Capital will flow more readily toward productive investment when housing is less tax-favoured as a wealth vehicle.
   4. Public revenue will strengthen as large untaxed gains are reduced in the base.
   5. Speculative “buy-and-hold for the discount” strategies will lose their edge as preferential treatment is removed.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**  
Australia moved from CGT indexation to a flat discount model in 1999. Indexation targets the core fairness question—taxing real gains rather than inflation—without granting an automatic windfall discount unrelated to inflation.

**Indexation precedent and current-law context**  
For certain pre-1999 assets, Australian tax law still allows indexation as an alternative to the discount, demonstrating that indexation is an established concept in the system.

**Structural limits**  
1. For assets acquired after the start date, the CGT discount is not available; the cost base is indexed for inflation using a defined indexation factor.  
2. Investment housing receives the tightened treatment first, reflecting its outsized role in speculation incentives.  
3. Transitional treatment is defined by acquisition date (grandfathering rules) to avoid retroactive taxation shocks.  
4. Integrity rules apply to prevent asset re-characterisation and wash-sale behaviour around the start date.

**Evidence and live policy discussion**  
Recent Parliamentary Budget Office costing work explicitly models replacing the CGT discount with cost-base indexation for non-property assets while removing the discount for investment properties under defined conditions, indicating indexation is being actively considered in contemporary reform design.

**Risk and failure modes**  
Risks include lock-in effects if poorly designed, or loopholes that preserve the discount’s effect through alternative concessions. Success depends on tight start-date rules and integrity provisions.

**Implementation outline**  
Implementation is delivered through amendments to CGT discount provisions, indexation factor definitions, transitional acquisition-date rules, and compliance guidance to support consistent application.

---
</details>

### **Stop Housing Being a Speculation Game**

1. Restrict negative gearing for housing so rental losses cannot be used to reduce tax on wages and salaries, with loss deductions quarantined to future rental income and capital gains within the housing portfolio.

   1. First-home buyers will face less investor bid pressure when purchasing established homes.
   2. Investment choices will shift toward rental performance and genuine housing demand rather than paper losses.
   3. Household finances will become more resilient as the tax system rewards sustainable returns instead of leverage.
   4. Government revenue will become more reliable as housing losses stop eroding the income tax base.
   5. Tax-driven property accumulation strategies will become less attractive than productive investment elsewhere.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**  
Negative gearing amplifies leveraged demand for existing dwellings by allowing losses to be offset against unrelated income. Quarantining losses keeps legitimate investment deductions available, while removing the incentive to run persistent losses primarily for tax advantage.

**Displacement and interaction with other reforms**  
This reform is designed to work alongside the Land Value Tax replacement of stamp duty and CGT reform. Together, they reduce speculative returns from holding existing dwellings and shift incentives toward productive use and new supply.

**Structural limits**  
1. Losses from residential rental property may not be deducted against wages and salaries.  
2. Losses are quarantined and may be applied only against future rental income or realised capital gains from residential property.  
3. The rule applies across individuals and pass-through entities commonly used for housing investment (trusts/partnership structures) to prevent simple routing avoidance.

**Risk and failure modes**  
Risks include avoidance via reclassification of expenses or restructuring of ownership. Integrity depends on clear definitions of deductible rental losses and consistent application across entity types.

**Implementation outline**  
Implementation proceeds through tax law amendments establishing quarantining, transitional rules for existing carried-forward losses, and integrity provisions for common avoidance structures.

---
</details>

### **Shift Rezoning Gains to Benefit the Public**

1. Apply a windfall gains tax to land value uplifts created by government rezoning decisions, capturing a share of rezoning-created value for public benefit rather than leaving it as an unearned private gain.

   1. Infrastructure and services will be better funded as rezoning uplifts contribute to public value.
   2. Communities will see a fairer return from public decisions that create sudden land value jumps.
   3. Planning reform will become more credible when rezoning benefits are shared rather than concentrated.
   4. Land banking will become less attractive as rezoning windfalls are no longer fully private.
   5. Pure “wait for rezoning” strategies will lose payoff as unearned uplift is no longer fully private.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**  
Rezoning can create a sudden uplift in land value that is driven by public decision-making rather than owner effort. A windfall gains tax captures part of that uplift and aligns rezoning with public benefit.

**Existing Australian precedent**  
Victoria already operates a windfall gains tax model that applies when rezoning increases land value above a threshold, with options to defer payment under specified conditions.

**Structural limits**  
1. Liability is calculated only on the uplift attributable to rezoning (the rezoning-driven increase in land value).
2. A minimum uplift threshold applies before any tax is payable (threshold design follows the precedent model).
3. Deferral is permitted under defined conditions with interest, to reduce cash-flow shock while preserving collection integrity.
4. The value of the tax is calculated at rezoning decision points and indexed until final sale, so windfalls are captured even when land is held.

**Risk and failure modes**  
Risks include valuation disputes, gaming around rezoning boundaries, or political pressure for exemptions. Integrity depends on valuation transparency and consistent uplift attribution.

**Implementation outline**  
Implementation requires a valuation method for pre- and post-rezoning land values, uplift assessment notices, a structured deferral pathway, and a clear interaction rule with Land Value Tax so the two taxes do not duplicate the same base at the same event.

### **Stop Wasting Our Best Land**

1. Establish National Minimum Housing Permissions that require states to ensure as-of-right housing capacity in defined priority locations, including activity centres, rail station catchments, and frequent public transport corridors, with planning schemes updated to reflect those minimum permissions.

   1. More homes will become possible in the places Australians already rely on for work, study, and services.
   2. Families will gain more realistic housing choices in established communities.
   3. Commutes will shorten as growth concentrates around existing infrastructure and service networks.
   4. Local businesses and main streets will strengthen as more people can live near centres and corridors.
   5. Infrastructure we have already built will support more people instead of sitting under-used.
   6. Housing supply will respond more predictably to demand when minimum permissions are consistent and predictable.
   7. Productive farmland will be better protected as growth shifts toward well-serviced urban land rather than outward sprawl.
   8. Public investment in transport and services will deliver stronger long-term returns through better land use.
   9. Scarcity pricing driven by artificial land constraints will weaken as more well-located homes become feasible.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**  
Australia’s major cities contain substantial amounts of well-located, well-serviced land where housing remains legally constrained despite proximity to transport, employment, and infrastructure. When growth is restricted in these areas, development shifts outward into fringe locations, increasing infrastructure cost and consuming productive agricultural land. Establishing a minimum permission standard changes the legal baseline so housing can occur where demand and infrastructure already exist without compromising design quality or safety requirements.

**Urban efficiency and farmland protection**  
1. Expanding housing capacity in well-serviced urban areas reduces pressure for fringe expansion.  
2. Reduced fringe expansion preserves high-value agricultural land surrounding metropolitan regions.  
3. More efficient land use lowers long-term public expenditure on new outer-suburban roads, utilities, and services.  
4. National food production capacity is indirectly supported when sprawl pressure is reduced.

**Structural framework**  
The Commonwealth requires states to embed minimum as-of-right permissions within defined priority geographies, ensuring that housing growth can occur where infrastructure already exists.

**Minimum permission geographies (baseline requirements)**  
1. Rail station catchments within a defined walkable radius.  
2. Designated activity centres in metropolitan and regional cities.  
3. Frequent public transport corridors meeting defined service thresholds.  
4. Existing main streets, shopping centres, and mixed-use commercial zones.

**Minimum allowable outcomes (baseline)**  
Within the priority geographies, planning schemes must permit, at minimum:
1. Medium density housing (terraces, townhouses, walk-ups).  
2. Mid-rise apartments in station and centre zones.  
3. Mixed-use buildings along main streets and centre cores (housing above retail/commerce).  
4. Lot consolidation and subdivision rules that enable feasible redevelopment.

**Integrity limits**  
1. Permissions must be genuinely as-of-right and not neutralised by blanket discretionary overlays.  
2. Environmental, heritage, and hazard constraints must be mapped and evidence-based.  
3. Agricultural land policy remains distinct; this reform does not rezone rural land for urban expansion.  
4. States may exceed minimum permissions but may not reduce them below the standard.

**Interaction with other reforms**  
Land Value Tax establishes a recurring incentive for efficient land use; minimum permissions ensure that incentive can translate into housing delivery where infrastructure exists.

**Risk and failure modes**  
Risks include token compliance (permissions that are technically legal but practically infeasible), substitution through discretionary overlays, or uneven application across councils. Failure would appear as continued exclusionary zoning in the defined geographies despite the standard.

**Implementation outline**  
Commonwealth legislation defines priority geographies and compliance certification. States incorporate minimum permissions into planning schemes, subject to federal funding linkage where applicable.

</details>

### **Create a Housing Approval Fast-Track**

1. Require a binding code-complying approval pathway for standard housing types so developments that meet published design and safety codes receive streamlined approval within fixed time limits, with councils limited to objective compliance checks rather than discretionary refusal.

   1. Home building will become more predictable as approvals follow clear rules rather than politics.
   2. Construction timelines will shorten as routine housing types move through faster assessment pathways.
   3. Smaller builders will gain fairer access as approval certainty reduces financing and holding-cost barriers.
   4. Neighbourhood change will become more orderly as standard forms are assessed against consistent criteria.
   5. Housing quality will improve as developers compete to meet clear, published standards rather than lobbying for exceptions.
   6. Costs will fall as risk premiums decline across design, finance, and approvals.
   7. Speculative land holding will become less attractive as redevelopment becomes a practical, bankable option for more sites.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**  
Even where zoning permits housing, discretionary assessment and unpredictable delays raise risk premiums and suppress delivery. A code-complying pathway converts routine housing proposals into a rules-based process, improving certainty without lowering safety or design requirements.

**Structural framework**  
The Commonwealth requires states to implement a code-complying pathway covering common redevelopment typologies. The pathway specifies objective standards, fixed decision timeframes, and limited refusal grounds.

**Covered typologies (baseline)**  
States must provide code pathways for, at minimum:
1. Terraces and townhouses.  
2. Low-rise walk-ups.  
3. Mid-rise apartments and mixed-use buildings in centre and corridor zones.  
4. Small-lot subdivision where services are available.

**Decision limits**  
1. Assessments are limited to objective compliance against published codes.  
2. Councils may refuse only for demonstrable non-compliance with the code, mapped hazard constraints, or safety-critical issues.  
3. Objections may inform compliance checks but cannot create discretionary veto power where the proposal complies.

**Time limits**  
1. Fixed statutory decision clocks apply by typology.  
2. Failure to decide within the clock triggers an automatic escalation pathway to a state assessment body.  
3. Final determination must occur within a fixed maximum timeframe.

**Integrity limits**  
1. The code pathway must not be neutralised through blanket overlays that reintroduce discretion for compliant forms.  
2. States must publish measurable compliance criteria and a transparent audit trail for refusals.

**Risk and failure modes**  
Risks include code capture, weak enforcement, or “shadow discretion” through informal practices. Failure would appear as persistent delay despite nominal code pathways.

**Implementation outline**  
Implementation is delivered through state planning law amendments establishing code standards, statutory clocks, and an escalation pathway, with compliance reporting and public metrics.

### **Reward Communities That Build Quality Homes**

1. Establish a Commonwealth Housing Delivery Accelerator that pays councils lump-sum bonuses for completed homes delivered in priority catchments under the minimum permission standard and code-complying pathway, with payments triggered only on verified completion.

   1. Councils will gain a direct financial incentive to approve housing that meets clear standards.
   2. Local services and infrastructure will improve as housing growth generates dedicated funding streams.
   3. Community confidence will rise as growth is paired with visible upgrades rather than unfunded strain.
   4. Housing delivery will accelerate as council decision-making is aligned with measurable outcomes.
   5. Councils will be better equipped to invest in planning capability, compliance, and enforcement.
   6. State planning reforms will become harder to quietly undermine as delivery outcomes are publicly measured and rewarded.
   7. Land hoarding will lose leverage as the system rewards actual delivery rather than delay and scarcity.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**  
Councils are resource-constrained while carrying responsibility for approvals, local infrastructure interfaces, and enforcement. A completion-triggered Housing Delivery Accelerator aligns council incentives with actual delivery rather than approvals or intentions, while providing funding that scales predictably with growth. Payments are structured around measurable housing outcomes and objective standards, encouraging durable, well-located, and broadly usable housing types without introducing aesthetic discretion or subjective design judgement.

**Base payment structure**  
1. A fixed base payment applies per verified completed dwelling.  
2. Payment is triggered only upon issuance of an occupancy certificate or equivalent completion certification.  
3. Payments are indexed to construction cost inflation to preserve incentive strength over time.

**Quality uplift tiers (objective criteria only)**  
Additional uplifts apply where a completed dwelling meets published, measurable standards:

1. **Family-capable dwelling uplift** — applied to dwellings meeting defined bedroom and minimum internal area thresholds (e.g. 2+ bedrooms with specified floor area).  
2. **Transport-priority uplift** — applied to dwellings delivered within defined rail station catchments, activity centres, or frequent public transport corridors.  
3. **Durability uplift** — applied to buildings meeting defined structural durability and energy efficiency classifications.  
4. **Mixed-use integration uplift** — applied where residential dwellings are delivered above active ground-floor commercial or community uses within designated centre zones.

All uplift thresholds must be numeric, published, and compliance-verifiable. Discretionary qualitative assessments are not permitted.

**Anti-distortion safeguards**  
1. Uplifts must not exceed a defined proportion of the base payment to avoid discouraging smaller or entry-level dwellings.  
2. Micro-dwellings below defined minimum habitable standards do not qualify for uplift tiers.  
3. Artificial subdivision of large dwellings to multiply base payments is excluded through minimum size standards.  
4. Councils may not impose additional approval barriers to favour uplift-eligible projects.

**Equity and geographic balance**  
1. Payment rates may vary by regional cost band to reflect construction cost differences across Australia.  
2. Regional and metropolitan jurisdictions are eligible under the same structural criteria.

**Audit and compliance**  
1. All payments are tied to geospatial and certification data.  
2. Public reporting discloses council-level completions, uplift category breakdowns, and total accelerator payments.  
3. Misclassification or manipulation triggers repayment and temporary disqualification.

**Interaction with other reforms**  
Minimum Housing Permissions expand legal capacity; the Fast-Track reduces approval risk; the Accelerator aligns council incentives with actual completed housing outcomes.

**Risk and failure modes**  
Risks include over-concentration in specific dwelling types, gaming of bedroom classifications, or uplift capture without genuine livability gains. Periodic review of objective criteria ensures incentives remain aligned with housing system performance.

**Implementation outline**  
Commonwealth legislation defines payment amounts, uplift criteria, indexing method, and reporting requirements. States and councils participate through automatic eligibility upon compliance with minimum permission and fast-track reforms.

### **Supply Integrated Public Housing at Scale**

1. Establish a Public Housing Acquisition Program that has enduring first right of purchase for a one defined floor of dwellings within new multi-unit residential developments, prioritising centrally located buildings and major transport corridors.

   1. Access to and usage of transport, services, and employment will improve when public housing is located in well-serviced centres.
   2. Public housing residents will not be isolated in service deserts where they have extra costs for living that maintain poverty traps.
   3. Mixed-tenure buildings will support social stability and reduce concentrated disadvantage.
   4. Public housing stock will grow automatically as cities grow.
   5. Maintenance standards will improve when dwellings operate within standard strata and building management structures.
   6. Long-term asset quality will strengthen when public housing is embedded in durable, privately delivered developments.
   7. Public land banking pressures will reduce as housing is acquired within existing development pipelines.

<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**
Traditional estate-style public housing concentrates disadvantage, isolates residents from employment nodes, and creates high long-term management costs. Integrating public housing within standard residential buildings embeds social inclusion structurally rather than attempting to repair it after segregation occurs.

**Acquisition structure**

1. A defined percentage of total dwellings within eligible multi-storey developments is acquired at market price upon completion.
2. Acquisition prioritises rail catchments, activity centres, and transport corridors defined in the Production phase.
3. Dwellings are purchased rather than mandated as in-kind developer contributions, preserving construction viability.
4. Ownership is consolidated under a public housing authority rather than distributed through third-party social housing entities.

**Scale expectation**
If applied consistently to medium and high-density developments in priority geographies, stock growth of approximately 1–2% of new metropolitan dwelling completions per year is achievable without direct state-led construction programs.

**Governance framework**

1. Public housing remains publicly owned.
2. Mixed-tenure buildings operate under standard strata governance arrangements.
3. Tenancy management is centralised under public authorities with national quality standards.

**Interaction with Production reforms**
Minimum Housing Permissions and the Housing Delivery Accelerator increase eligible development volume in transit-connected areas, expanding acquisition opportunity without requiring additional rezoning.

**Risk and failure modes**
Risks include over-concentration within specific developments, acquisition pricing disputes, or reduction in developer pipeline participation if poorly calibrated. Integrity depends on predictable acquisition rules and avoidance of discretionary negotiation.

**Implementation outline**
Federal legislation establishes funding authority, eligibility criteria, acquisition proportion, and reporting standards. States retain tenancy administration consistent with national public housing benchmarks.

### **Guarantee Secure and Safe Renting**

1. Establish National Rental Security Standards that prohibit no-grounds evictions, require minimum property safety standards, and reform Commonwealth Rent Assistance to reflect a defined proportion of actual rent paid.

   1. Renters will gain greater housing stability when tenancy cannot be terminated without defined cause.
   2. Unsafe and substandard rental conditions will decline under enforceable national minimum standards.
   3. Households will experience less sudden displacement during tight market conditions.
   4. Rental assistance will better reflect real housing costs when indexed to a defined share of rent rather than a flat schedule.
   5. Income volatility and poverty traps associated with rental stress will reduce.
   6. Responsible landlords will compete on property quality and service rather than tenant turnover leverage.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**
Supply reform addresses structural scarcity over time, but renters require immediate stability. National standards set a consistent baseline for tenancy security and property safety across jurisdictions, reducing regulatory fragmentation while preserving state administration.

**Security of tenure framework**

1. Tenancies may only be terminated for defined causes, including breach, owner occupation, or lawful redevelopment.
2. Notice periods are standardised nationally.
3. Retaliatory or strategic eviction practices are subject to defined penalties.

**Minimum rental standards**

1. Properties must meet published safety and habitability criteria prior to lease commencement.
2. Essential repairs are subject to mandatory response timeframes.
3. Independent certification or compliance reporting may be required in defined categories.

**Commonwealth Rent Assistance reform**

1. Rent Assistance is recalibrated toward a defined share target of actual rent paid, up to a capped maximum.
2. Payment levels are indexed to rental market data rather than CPI alone.
3. Reform integrates with existing welfare systems without creating parallel programs.

**Interaction with other reforms**
Land Value Tax and negative gearing reform moderate speculative pressure; production reforms expand supply; rental standards stabilise households during system transition.

**Risk and failure modes**
Excessive regulatory burden could discourage rental supply if poorly calibrated. Integrity depends on clear definitions, enforceable standards, and coordination with state tenancy frameworks.

**Implementation outline**
Commonwealth legislation establishes funding-linked national tenancy benchmarks and Rent Assistance reforms. States retain tribunal administration subject to baseline standards.

### **Connect Regions with High Speed Rail**

1. Deliver high-speed regional rail corridors between major cities with strategically located regional stops to create new affordable residential options and vibrant economic corridors.

   1. Families will gain access to new affordable housing options within practical commuting range of major employment centres.
   2. Housing demand pressure on capital cities will diffuse as commuting distances shrink in time rather than geography.
   3. Regional centres will become more viable long-term residential alternatives.
   4. Economic opportunity will spread more evenly across connected corridors.
   5. Infrastructure investment will support both housing expansion and regional productivity.
   6. Land values in established capitals will face reduced scarcity pressure as alternative markets become realistically accessible.
   7. Existing regional towns will grow in a more planned and infrastructure-supported manner rather than through ad hoc sprawl.

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Detail</strong></summary>

---

**Design rationale**
Housing scarcity in major cities reflects concentrated employment and limited commuting range. High-speed rail alters the effective housing catchment of employment centres by reducing travel time, enabling residential choice across wider geographic areas without requiring relocation away from metropolitan labour markets.

**Housing-system interaction**

1. Regional rail nodes become natural growth centres under the same Minimum Housing Permission framework used in metropolitan areas.
2. Fast-tracked approval pathways operate at designated corridor stops.
3. Land-value and rezoning-capture mechanisms apply same as anywhere to limit speculative profiteering.

**Structural framework**

1. Corridors connect major capitals with defined regional centres.
2. Stop selection is limited to locations capable of absorbing planned housing growth.
3. Housing capacity obligations apply to designated station catchments.

**Economic logic**
Travel-time compression expands the functional labour market radius, increasing the effective housing supply available to metropolitan economies without increasing urban congestion or fringe sprawl.

**Risk and failure modes**
Risks include under-utilised stations, speculative land inflation prior to delivery, or disconnect between transport delivery and housing permission reform. Integrity requires simultaneous application of zoning and tax mechanisms at corridor designation.

**Implementation outline**
Commonwealth-led corridor development with staged construction, priority routing, and binding housing capacity conditions at designated stops.
